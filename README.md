# My @namespace/my-lib

A really small CSS framework template.
This is just a template for a CSS framework. It is not a framework itself.

It already provides a few things:
- A build system with postcss
- A documentation setup with astro, mdx and syntax highlighting
- Some basic CSS variables (colors, fonts, etc.)
- Sample button component

You need to:
- Change the name in the package.json & readme.
- Customize you colors and other variables
- Customize the readme
- Customize/improve the documentation
  - Navigation
  - Styling
  - ...
- Create your own css components and add documentation for them
- Publish it to npm or other registry
 
### Quick start

Customize the information how to use the framework.

To install

```bash
npm install @namespace/my-lib
```

To use

```js
import "@namespace/my-lib"
```

### Contribute

```bash
# development
yarn dev

# build
yarn build
```
